A Software Development Kit, also called a “devkit” or SDK, is a set of development tools that allows software engineers to create customized applications for a particular software package, software framework, hardware platform, or operating system. This allows developers to create applications specific to their business needs that will interact with the product or products developed by the SDK creators.
